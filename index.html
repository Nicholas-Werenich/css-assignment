        <h2 class="home-sub-heading">The Purpose of Treaty 3</h2>
        <p>
          The Canadian government created a treaty with the
          <span>Saulteaux</span> (also called Anishinaabe and are a branch of
          the Ojibwe) to build the new <span>Canadian Pacific Railway.</span> If
          it were to go from Lake Superior to the Red River, it would have to
          pass through their territory. The negotiations took 2 years and was
          signed on October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1873.
        </p>

        <h2 class="home-sub-heading">The Terms of the Treaty</h2>
        <p>
          The Canadian government agreed to pay a one time fee of $12 per
          person, $5 yearly and provide farming equipment for the
          <span>Saulteaux.</span> The <span>Saulteaux</span> in turn surrendered
          their rights to their land, but kept the ability to hunt and fish on
          the land until the goverment used it for different purposes.

        <h2 class="home-sub-heading">Who was Involved</h2>
        <p>
          Those involved in the signing of the treaty were the
          <span>Saulteaux</span> people and the Candadian government. Some bands
          were unable to make it to the negotiations but they were added in an
          adhesion in 1873 and another in 1874. Shortly after, the
          <span>Metis</span> around the land of treaty three were added in
          another adhesion in 1875.
