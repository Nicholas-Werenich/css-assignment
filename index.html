      <h2>The Purpose of Treaty 3</h2>
      <p>
        After negotiating for 2 years, the Canadian government tried to
        negociate a treaty with the Ojibwe based on the new Canadian Pacific
        Railway. If it were to go from Lake Superior to the Red River, it would
        have to pass through their territory.

      <h2>The Terms of the Treaty</h2>
      <p>
        The Canadian government agreed to pay a one time fee of $12 per person,
        $5 yearly and provide farming equipment for the Ojibwe. The Ojibwe in
        turn surrendered their rights to their land, but kept the ability to
        hunt and fish on the land until the goverment used it for different
        purposes.

      <h2>Who was Involved</h2>
      <p>
        Those involved in the signing of the treaty were the Saulteaux (Ojibwe)
        people and the Candadian government. Some bands were unable to make it
        to the negotiations but they were added in an adhesion in 1873 and
        another in 1874. Shortly after, the Metis around the land of treaty
        three were added in another adhesion in 1875.
